# Diana Cryptosystem Encoder / Decoder
Courtney Imbert, courtneyimbert@gmail.com

This short program is a python implementation of the polyalphabetic, symmetric Diana Cryptosystem. Diana was in use by U.S. Special Forces during the Vietnam War. It encrypts/decrypts strings using a One Time Pad (OTP) or key. The algorithm is similar to a Vernam
or Vigenere cipher.

Later I may add features like stripping non-ascii characters in the plaintext (other than spaces), generating random OTP values, specifying pre-shared sections of the OTP to start from, etc.

This program is for personal hobbyist and puzzle use. It is NOT a secure method for encrypting data. I wrote it for fun.
